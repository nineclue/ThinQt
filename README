This is a demo and small utility written for me.

Qt application and Thin server are running within EventMachine's run loop. (qt_kendo)
Qt application uses QtWebkit which loads kendoui javascript library to query data from thin server.
User can supply custom class for data. (see rad_info.rb)

Kendoui Javascript library by Telerik.
